# My Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This collection showcases various projects I've developed to demonstrate my skills in different programming languages and areas. Feel free to explore each project to learn more about my abilities and interests.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. Minesweeper (Python)

* **Description:** A classic Minesweeper game implemented using Python and the Tkinter library . This project demonstrates my understanding of:
    * GUI development with Tkinter.
    * Game logic implementation.
    * Object-oriented programming principles in Python.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Python, Tkinter, GUI Development, Game Logic, Event Handling, OOP.
* **How to Run:**
    1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    2.  Navigate to the `Minesweeper` directory.
    3.  Run the game using the command: `python Minesweeper.py`.

### 2. Brickout (Java)

* **Description:** A rendition of the classic Brickout arcade game developed using Java. This project highlights my skills in:
    * Game development in Java.
    * Handling game loops and animation.
    * Collision detection.
    * Basic game physics.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Java, Game Development, Game Loops, Animation, Collision Detection, Basic Physics.

### 3. Assembly Assignments

* **Description:** This section contains a collection of assignments completed in Assembly language. These projects demonstrate my understanding of:
    * Low-level programming concepts.
    * Processor architecture x86.
    * Memory management at a fundamental level.
    * Implementing basic algorithms in Assembly.
* **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Assembly Language x86_64, Low-Level Programming, Processor Architecture, Memory Management, Algorithm Implementation.
* **How to Explore:** The assembly files are provided with comments explaining the logic and functionality. You will likely need an assembler to run and test these assignments. Please refer to the individual assignment files for specific instructions or tools used.

### 4. Gmail Site (C++ - Early-Stage Team Project)

* **Description:** This is an early-stage, collaborative project with the ambitious goal of replicating core functionalities of the Gmail website using C++. While the project is still in its initial development phases, my contributions focused on crucial backend components and project management aspects. This experience allowed me to demonstrate my skills in:
    * **C++ Programming:** Developing and implementing key features.
    * **Object-Oriented Design:** Contributing to the project's architectural structure.
    * **Team Collaboration:** Working effectively within a development team.
    * **Project Management:** Utilizing GitHub for version control and Jira for task tracking and workflow management.
    * **Experimentation:** Exploring the use of Docker for potential deployment and environment consistency.

* **Key Contributions:** My specific responsibilities and accomplishments within this project included:
    * **Developing Unit Tests:** Creating comprehensive tests for various classes to ensure code quality and reliability.
    * **Jira Management:** Actively managing the Jira board, including task creation, assignment, progress tracking, and workflow optimization.
    * **Bloom Filter Implementation:** Designing and implementing a Bloom filter for efficient set membership testing, likely for features like spam detection or URL filtering.
    * **File I/O Operations:** Implementing robust functions for handling file-related tasks, such as reading from and writing to blacklists.
    * **Core Functionality Implementation:** Developing significant functions, including `CheckUrl` and `DeleteURL`.

* **Current Status:** The project is currently in its early stages and does not yet offer full Gmail functionality. The implemented features include a basic menu allowing users to interact with a blacklist, enabling them to add and remove specific websites.

* **How to Explore:** The C++ source files are available for review, showcasing the implemented functionalities and the project's current structure. Detailed instructions on how to build and run the project, along with any necessary dependencies, can be found in the `README.md` file located within the project directory.
